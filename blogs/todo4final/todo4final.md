\text{\textcolor{red}{!THIS IS A TODO LIST!}}
$$

I just realized that I have less than four months left as an undergraduate. Due to my application preparations , my life has almost come to a standstill—everything has revolved around studying, and nothing much else has changed. I want to make the most of my remaining time at Sichuan University.

Before graduation, I gonna:

- [ ]  ⛩️ Visit **OSAKA**, which I planned to do in last December but cancelled.
- [ ]  🎢 Try a **ROLLER COASTER**, which I was too afraid to ride at Hong Kong Disneyland.
- [ ]  🚿 Go to a **BIG BATHHOUSE with friends** and stay up all night, as it was a deal we made if we both received PhD/master/job offers.
- [ ]  ⛷️ Go **SKIING**, something I’ve always wanted to do but couldn’t, since there’s no snow in South China.
- [ ]  📚 Complete **COMPUTER GRAPHICS (CMU 15-462/662)**, because it’s a subject I’ve always been passionate about but didn't have time to learn.
- [ ] … Keep tuned!
